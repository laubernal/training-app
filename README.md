## Why I built this app

Back in 2019 I started going to the gym and since then I've been hooked up. 
Although it was in early 2021 when I wanted to really know how I was performing, 
and in mid 2021 I started to learn how to code so I thought it would be a great app to learn, experiment and to keep me motivated in this long journey.  

Building this app has been a huge challenge but it has given me a lot of learnings and I have been able to overcome lots of obstacles.
